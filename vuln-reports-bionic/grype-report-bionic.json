Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations.

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5363","epss":0.0108,"percentile":0.77012,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-5363","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"38427b973a0bcf3c","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1\\~18.04.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssl1.1@1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-0553","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-0553","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","epss":0.01057,"percentile":0.76784,"date":"2025-09-05"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5285},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-0553","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0553","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0533","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0627","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0796","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1082","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1108","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1383","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2094","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0553","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258412","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522","https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2024-January/004841.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/19/3","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0533","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0627","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0796","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1082","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1108","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1383","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2094","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0553","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258412","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7ZEIOLORQ7N6WRPFXZSYDL2MC4LP7VFV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GNXKVR5YNUEBNHAHM5GSYKBZX4W2HMN2/","https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2024-January/004841.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0011/"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in GnuTLS.

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","epss":0.01537,"percentile":0.80671,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-6129","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"38427b973a0bcf3c","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1\\~18.04.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssl1.1@1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-6779","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-6779","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6779","epss":0.00708,"percentile":0.71331,"date":"2025-09-05"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.35400000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-6779","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6779","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176932/glibc-syslog-Heap-Based-Buffer-Overflow.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Feb/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6779","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254395","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D2FIH77VHY3KCRROCXOT6L27WMZXSJ2G/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MWQ6BZJ6CV5UAW4VZSKJ6TO4KIW2KWAQ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240223-0006/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/30/6","https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176932/glibc-syslog-Heap-Based-Buffer-Overflow.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Feb/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6779","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254395","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D2FIH77VHY3KCRROCXOT6L27WMZXSJ2G/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MWQ6BZJ6CV5UAW4VZSKJ6TO4KIW2KWAQ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240223-0006/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/30/6","https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt"],"description":"An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library.

nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-11080","epss":0.00566,"percentile":0.67529,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"nghttp2","version":"1.30.0-1ubuntu1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-11080","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"839771142f972cee","name":"libnghttp2-14","version":"1.30.0-1ubuntu1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libnghttp2-14/copyright","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libnghttp2-14/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libnghttp2-14:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libnghttp2-14:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","Expat","GPL-3","GPL-3+","MIT","SIL-OFL-1.1","all-permissive"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libnghttp2-14:libnghttp2-14:1.30.0-1ubuntu1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libnghttp2-14:libnghttp2_14:1.30.0-1ubuntu1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libnghttp2_14:libnghttp2-14:1.30.0-1ubuntu1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libnghttp2_14:libnghttp2_14:1.30.0-1ubuntu1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libnghttp2:libnghttp2-14:1.30.0-1ubuntu1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libnghttp2:libnghttp2_14:1.30.0-1ubuntu1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libnghttp2-14@1.30.0-1ubuntu1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=nghttp2","upstreams":[{"name":"nghttp2"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-46218","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-46218","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-46218","epss":0.00432,"percentile":0.61838,"date":"2025-09-05"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.216},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-46218","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46218","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-46218.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/2212193","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3ZX3VW67N4ACRAPMV2QS2LVYGD7H2MVE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UOGXU25FMMT2X6UUITQ7EZZYMJ42YWWD/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5587","https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-46218.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/2212193","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3ZX3VW67N4ACRAPMV2QS2LVYGD7H2MVE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UOGXU25FMMT2X6UUITQ7EZZYMJ42YWWD/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5587"],"description":"This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set \"super cookies\" in curl that\nare then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or\npossible.

For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used\nwith the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6237","epss":0.00524,"percentile":0.66033,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-6237","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"38427b973a0bcf3c","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1\\~18.04.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssl1.1@1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-28322","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-28322","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28322","epss":0.00502,"percentile":0.65061,"date":"2025-09-05"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.15059999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-28322","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28322","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52","https://hackerone.com/reports/1954658","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52","https://hackerone.com/reports/1954658","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845"],"description":"An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously wasused to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\n\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted\nsources might terminate abruptly.\n\nA file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an\nuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","epss":0.00332,"percentile":0.55447,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-0727","versionConstraint":"none

improper certificate validation vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way it supports matching of wildcard patterns when listed as \"Subject Alternative Name\" in TLS server certificates. curl

After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and

We are currently unaware of any such applications.\n\nThe AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated\ndata entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the\napplication has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with\nNULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.\nThe AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call\ninstead of performing the associated data authentication operation.\nThe empty data thus will not be authenticated.\n\nAs this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and\nwe expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data\nentries this is qualified as Low severity issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2975","epss":0.00166,"percentile":0.38136,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-2975","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"38427b973a0bcf3c","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1\\~18.04.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssl1.1@1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-31439","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-31439","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-31439","epss":0.00094,"percentile":0.2721,"date":"2025-09-05"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.047},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-31439","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31439","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald","https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/journald-publication.pdf","https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/28885","https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases","https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald","https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/journald-publication.pdf","https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/28885","https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases"],"description":"An issue was discovered in systemd 253.

NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","epss":0.00153,"percentile":0.36617,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"gcc-8","version":"8.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4039","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"176b5cdebb03a93d","name":"libstdc++6","version":"8.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:4cbd8e5667cd308df51b0ad61b2c43dcfa4dca2dac6703642b96677835ac34a5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/gcc-8-base/copyright","layerID":"sha256:548a79621a426b4eb077c926eabac5a8620c454fb230640253e1b44dc7dd7562","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libstdc++6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libstdc++6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:548a79621a426b4eb077c926eabac5a8620c454fb230640253e1b44dc7dd7562","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libstdc++6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Artistic","GFDL-1.2","GPL","GPL-2","GPL-3","LGPL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libstdc\\+\\+6:libstdc\\+\\+6:8.4.0-1ubuntu1\\~18.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libstdc%2B%2B6@8.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=gcc-8","upstreams":[{"name":"gcc-8"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-47100","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-47100","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47100","epss":0.00079,"percentile":0.2413,"date":"2025-09-05"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0395},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-47100","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47100","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/12c313ce49b36160a7ca2e9b07ad5bd92ee4a010","https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/7047915eef37fccd93e7cd985c29fe6be54650b6","https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/ff1f9f59360afeebd6f75ca1502f5c3ebf077da3","https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/12c313ce49b36160a7ca2e9b07ad5bd92ee4a010","https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/7047915eef37fccd93e7cd985c29fe6be54650b6","https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/ff1f9f59360afeebd6f75ca1502f5c3ebf077da3"],"description":"In Perl before 5.38.2, S_parse_uniprop_string in regcomp.c can write to unallocated space because a property name associated with a \\p{...} regular expression construct is mishandled.

summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking\nexcessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to\ngenerate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.  Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nDH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of\nother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other\nfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this

vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","epss":0.00064,"percentile":0.20148,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"perl","version":"5.26.1-6ubuntu0.7"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-47039","versionConstraint":"none
